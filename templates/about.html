    <p class="lead">We wanted to make you laugh, and we wanted to do it differently.</p>
    <p class="card-text">TxTJokes is a Twilio sms example application created during the Twilio and Dev.to hackathon 2020.</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>Created by Glenn Paquette, Txt jokes is a Django web application which uses PyJokes, & Twilio to send you nerd jokes by sms.<br>
    The site is styled with Bootstrap 4 and Bootswatch and is redered with Django's built in templating engine.</p>
    <p>Further development includes schedualed joke delivery, sending gifs, expanding the joke library, and sending via alternative means - such as slack or whatsapp.<br>
    We further would like to collect stats such as # of jokes sent, and accept feedback from recepients.</p>
